            A feature tensor of shape (1, 1024, T_out, H_out, W_out)
            as returned by i3d.extract_features(...). 
            If you've already removed the batch dimension, you can pass 
            shape (1024, T_out, H_out, W_out) insteadâ€”just adjust accordingly.
    
    Note:
        1) We average across the 1024 channels to get shape [T_out, H_out, W_out].
        2) Then we iterate through T_out frames, creating a heatmap per time step.
        3) This function uses plt.show() to display an interactive animation 
           (best run in a Jupyter notebook or an interactive Python session).
